## Grading 



- [ ] Three charts

- [ ] One graph

- [ ] Backround/motivation

- [ ] Reflection

  - [ ] Tell me a bit about your process – what key decisions did you make? What inspirations did you use
  - [ ] How did you apply the principles of CRAP? 
  - [ ] For your charts, how did you apply Cairo’s qualities of great visualizations?

- [ ] Timing of presentation 

  - [ ] 6min or less		6
  - [ ] 6 min to 6:30.      5
  - [ ] 6:30 to 7:30.        4

  - [ ] 9:30 +.                   1

  Three factors to consider (consistently) 

- [ ] Does the table add anything

- [ ] Are the sources cited in graphs

- [ ] Did folks to White ue correclty

General feedback: 

- Unified color shemes can be bold or can be calm. Do what works for you 
- Motivation --> encouae you to motivate from the perspective of economics or policy - why woudl your "audience" care? Personal motivation is great to share in reflection (I love learning about it!) But for a presentation itself, focus on the broader reasons.
- Think about each chart you produce -> does the method you've chosen reflect what you would like it to accomplish? (If you are highlighting differences, is that easy to see? If not, can you cahgne the chart type, add labels, adjust proximity?) Are there redundant charts or tables? Sometimes, I ssaw tables that were just a numerical representation of a chart - this isn't ideal - usaually one or the other method is better /clearer for conveyin your information 
- A lot of unified color schemes - well done! I did see a few folks brinign in a LOT of colors. I don't have a rule for what is "too many", but I'd agoing doing things like alternative slide background colors or using >8 colors. It slows down our ability to process. 
- Aligning research questions with data is an interative process
- Make sure labels aren't so small difficult to read
