### Standard themes: 

[Standard themes](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html): review of all 8 themes included w/ `ggplot2()`



### Packages

- [`ggthemes()`](https://github.com/jrnold/ggthemes) 
  - Additional documentation of possibilities with [`ggthemes()`](https://yutannihilation.github.io/allYourFigureAreBelongToUs/ggthemes/)
- [**hrbrthemes**](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/hrbrthemes)
- [**ggthemr**](https://github.com/cttobin/ggthemr)
- [**ggtech**](https://github.com/ricardo-bion/ggtech)
- [**tvthemes**](https://ryo-n7.github.io/2019-05-16-introducing-tvthemes-package/)
- [**ggpomological**](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/project/ggpomological/) (trickier installation)

And of course, [there are more!](https://rfortherestofus.com/2019/08/themes-to-improve-your-ggplot-figures/)

Note: for some packages that include fonts, you will need to have the necessary fonts already on your system. For example `hrbrthemes` uses [Roboto Condensed](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Condensed?preview.text_type=custom) and a few others, and the beautiful `ggpomological` uses [Homemade Apple.](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Homemade+Apple)





### Interactive theme editing

What?! 

Yes. 

Try it out with `ggThemeAssist()`

1. Install `ggThemeAssist`: `install.packages("ggThemeAssist")`
2. Load the library: `library(ggThemeAssist)`
3. Make a plot and save it as an object `myplot <- ggplot(data = stuff, mapping = ....)`
4. Call the plot: `myplot`
5. Highlight code that calls the plot with your mouse
6. Click on "add-ins" (see below)
7. Then select "ggplot Theme Assistant"
8. Go nuts!
