[Ec137] Project Showcase 



Group 1: Pat, Martin, Kylie only 

Pat --> great colors. Can you clean up your table - less intensive colors, easier to read, no breaks

like the changes that's a good way of thinking it 

Big idea --> 	





General comments: 

## Nitpicky

### Formatting

- Don't forget (1) master slide, (2) fancy fonts (3) fancy colors. Doesn't need to be radical, but should show use of tech. I have added a video about powerpoint slides. 

To embed fonts, head to File --> Preferences --> Save, and then check the option for "font embedding" 

### Graphs 

- If side-by-side graphs that we are supposed to compare, keep axes the same (and font sizes the same)
- If you are using stacked bar charts, think about whether
- X-axis labels - if dates. Ideal for labels to fit horizontally



### What if fonts make me hate my life? 

- First check to make sure you've actually installed the font (on a Mac, open "Font Book" - it's a thing)
- Then, close PowerPoint. 
- Then, open PowerPoint
- If none of those things work --> to the Google! You may need to update PowerPoint, or reach out to me if it's not agreeing with you. 

### How long should my reflection be? 

Long enough that you answer the questions. If it's more than a page single spaced, it's probably too long. 

### References



-  You should note the data source on each chart/table. Doesn't need to be a full citation, but something at the bottom of the slide that says "Current Population Survey" or "Bureau of Labor Statistics" , etc. Just so we know what you're looking at 

- If you are using IPUMS data like we did in class, you are using data from the *Current Population Survey*. For your reference list, you should use the full IPUMS citation. They provide [clear instructions](https://cps.ipums.org/cps/citation.shtml) on how to do it (They prefer Flood et al.)

  

### Presentation 

I would recommend writing out a script or at least talking points for each slide. If you are someone who is not always super comfortable staring at your computer screen while talking, I would strongly recommend it! 

An excellent presentation should be relatively smooth - talking us through the ideas and concepts and guiding us 

An okay presentation would have a good amount of reading off the slides

A presentation that needs work would involve you reading off the slides, or just showing the slides w/o discussion.
