# Capstone 02 



TLDR; Make something similar to what you did for Capstone 01, but do it with R. You can also think about inequality if that's your jam. 



## Research questions



### Global inequality: 

How has inequality changed for countries in a particular region over time? 

	1. Install the WDI package
 	2. You can use the WDI search tools embedded in the package, or you can dig around the World Bank [data repository](https://data.worldbank.org/) here to get a better sense of the possibilities
 	3. Select a region of the world of interest to you. Examine how inequality has changed over time at the country level across various indicators. 
 	4. Explore the correlations between inequality and another potentially relevant factor, taking note that these explorations are not sufficient to give us evidence of causality. It could be GDP/capita, poverty rates, etc. 



### US inequality 

Opportunity Insights has fantastic data available on inequality in the United States. You can download `.csv` files (labelled as "Excel") and then import them into R. Explore one of the topics.
