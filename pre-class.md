For this class period, we're diving into more recent factors that have affected labor force participation rates. 

In short, for Tuesday's readings, we saw a **big** **rise** in LFPR for women, and a **modest decline** for men. In this week's readings, we'll add a few new factors that were not included in these earlier papers

Here's what I'd like you to do. 

1. Check your feedback from me on your PC03-01 (Tuesday's submission). Most of you did a great job, but a few got mixed up and measured the trends in LFPR over time with either charts and graphs. What we're looking for is things that *might explain* these trends. 

2. Enjoy the readings. Note down main takeaways from each reading. 

3. Take your table from PC03-01 and **add these new factors into your table**. The goal here is that you would have one, clear table that tells a reader the following: 

   (1) what factors affected labor force participation rates historically and more recently

   (2) whether they led to increases or decreases in rates

   (3) and whether they affected men, women, or everyone

*For some people, this may be as simple as adding a few more rows or columns. For the folks who went astray on Tuesday, it means making an entirely new table.* 

Then, answer *some or all* of the following prompts, making sure that your answers total **at least 300 words**.

1. Why has Covid-19 differentially affected men's and women's labor force participation rates? 
2. Of all the factors we've covered in the readings, which factors do you think are likely to be most important in the next decade? Or more specifically, what do you expect will happen to labor force participation rates overall, for men, and for women in the coming 10 years, and why?
3. Reviewing the set of tables in *Women in the Labor Force*, what trend or pattern stands out most to you? What questions does it raise?

This time, I just need a word doc or pdf from you that contains these two things: (1) your table, and (2) answers to the reflection questions

As before, there are lots of ways to do this. You may find it easy to add on to your existing table, or you may want to restructure. 

​      In a word doc or PDF, include the following: 

​		(a) notes on main takeaways from readings (part 3 above)

​        (b) your revised table

​       Also attach your excel file, please! 



*If you received a comment that either (a) you did not have a table, or (b) there were some major issues with your table, please take these notes into consideration.*



Revisit your original table you submitted on Tuesday. Update your table with "recent" reasons based on the readings from today. Add at least four new reasons. 

Now is a good time to also make sure your table is attractive and interpretable.

#### **<u>Prompts</u>**

We're going to plot the six unemployment measures to get a sense of the stories they tell.

1. Visit FRED. Download the **monthly**, **seasonally adjusted** unemployment rates (U-1, U-2, U-3, U-4, U-5, U-6) from 1994 until the present. You can search for these individually, or you can visit [here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release/tables?rid=50&eid=4773#snid=4775). 
2. Combine these all into one Excel worksheet, where each row is one month and each column is a different measure. 

2. Make a line graph that plots each unemployment measure over time. Make the chart attractive and clear
3. Paste the chart in a word document and, based on your readings, answer the following questions (minimum 200 words)
   1. Why did U-1 and U-2 diverge so much in 2020? What does it tell you? 
   2. If we think of unemployment as indicating how many people want to work but are not working, what measure of unemployment do you think is most informative, and why?
   3. What demographic groups have seen the most severe unemployment during the Covid-19 pandemic?
4. Upload your workbook and Word doc into BB.

Ooh, this will be a fun one! 

1. Do the readings (always a good idea!)

2. **Pick one state**. It could be one near to your heart, or one you'd like to visit. Or maybe one that feels good to say, like "Mississippi"

3. Find two things: 

   1. [Unemployment claims data](https://oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/claims.asp) by week (# of new claims, # of continuing claims)
   2. Number of unemployed people by month (seasonal)

   Restrict the time period from 01/01/2020-present

   *:eyes:! These should be # of people, not rates*

4. Make one graph with these three series (lines) on it. 

   There are two tricky things here: 

   1. Getting out tables from text (copy and past should work, but it will take some formatting)
   2. Making a weekly chart and a monthly chart line up on the same x axis. The brute force method I know is to start with the weekly data and paste in the monthly data (there are only 12 observations!). You can apply the Januay 2020 data to Jan 4,11,18, and 25. 
   3. Make it as pretty as you like

5. Paste it in a word doc, and write a few sentences explaining why numbers for UI and unemployment might differ

Suppose you could recommend a re-distribution of funds across programs (or to new programs) - but no increasing! What would you suggest? 

a) Make a chart of your choosing that shows two things: (1) the actual distribution of US spending across these categories. (2) your preferred distribution. You may prefer to do this with one or two charts. 

b) Write a justification of at least 150 words for your proposed reallocation. Compared to the current allocation, how would your redistribution affect low-income families with children? Low-income families without children? The elderly? Bullet points are fine.

We'll share these w/ our groupmates in class on Thursday.

Let's consider a few dimensions of the role of safety net programs during (and after) economic crises. (1) whether the program is effective at stabilizing incomes during economic downturns; (2) whether the program actually reduces poverty; and (3) whether the program could lead to a "poverty trap" that disencentivizes leaving poverty because of a potential loss of benefits. 

1. Consider the
