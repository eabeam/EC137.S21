Dear all, 

Thanks for your understanding with the changes this week! I've been able to revisit our calendar and wanted to share with you some adjustments. 

**Big picture changes:** 

​	**Exercise 3:** Revised deadline is April 04 @ 11:59pm (*1 week postponement*)

​	**Capstone 2:** Revised deadline is April 25 @ 11:59pm (*1 week postponement*)

​	**Exercise 6:** I am eliminating Exercise 6. I will apply your highest Exercise 1-5 grade in lieu of it to avoid overweighting the past assignments. (That is, Exercise 1 will still be 1/6 of your homework grade, not 1/5). 

​	**Unit 3**: We're making such good progress w/ Excel and R, and I want to lock it in! I am reworking Unit 3 to be a "Putting it all together" unit, rather than working with Tableau. We'll tackle higher education policy and student debt using either R or Excel (**you can pick**). If the loss of Tableau makes you very sad, then you should e-mail me and we can talk about ways to integrate Tableau into your remaining assignments. 

**Looking forward for Tuesday**

On Tuesday, we'll do the lesson we intended to do with refining our `ggplot` graphs. I have been talking with a few of you who are feeling quite lost, and I haven't been able to set up supplementary meetings. What we'll do on Tuesday is that if you're feeling comfortable "enough," you'll spend the second half of class in groups working on an activity. If you're feeling lost or having problems with R being "weird," we'll do a review/troubleshooting session together. 

Please don't hesitate if you have any additional question! Have a wonderful weekend.



Emily
