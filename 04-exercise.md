# Exercise 4

**Due 18 April @ 11:59pm**

[TOC]

==**You can work individually or in groups of 2 or 3.**== If you work in pairs/groups, you **may submit one assignment for all of you.** 

**There is no associated Exercise 04 Quiz**.



## Objectives

In short, Exercise 04 is about **building readiness for Capstone 02**. Essentially, I'm just making you do some of your Capstone 02 work in advance. 

Because Capstone 02 can be done individually or in groups of 2 or 3, you can *also* do this for Exercise 4! 

Is it okay if things change between now and Capstone 02? Of course. 



## Getting started

Start by reading the two introductions to Capstone 02

- Read through the [project description](Capstone 02.html) and prompts
- Read the specifications powerpoint:  	[pptx](Capstone2_Presentation.pptx)		[pdf](Capstone2_Presentation.pdf)

Think about what you might want to do!



There are two options for this exercise: 

**Option A:** Proposal + graph demo

**Option B:** Slide deck 

Both require <u>two charts.</u>



## Option A: Proposal + graph demo

*For my own sanity, please complete this entire assignment in R Markdown and then knit to just one document*

### Part 1: Idea proposal

Complete this idea proposal. It can be *literally* three medium-complete sentences. It can be more if you have questions

1. Frame your topic as a question. What is that question you will answer?
2. What is the data source you are going to use? 
3. Who are you working with and/or are you looking for a project buddy? Correct answers include but are not limited to: 
   1. I'm working by myself and I'm happy about that
   2. I'm working with Ashley and we would be open to one more person
   3. I'm working with James and Tyra.

### Part 2: Exploratory work

*Within your Markdown document, write code that does the following*

1. Load your dataset into R
2. Take a look at that data 
3. Make two charts. These can be *extremely* rough. But, there should be **two**. You may decide to use all of them in your presentation. You may decide to use none or one. 

### Submit

Knit  your Markdown file and submit the output

## Option B: Rough draft

Submit the rough draft of your slide deck. To be considered complete "enough," you should have at least the following: 

	 - Frame of entire presentation (gaps ok)
	 - Versions of at least two charts - it is okay if they are rough.

More complete = more feedback!

### Submit

Submit your slide deck as a pdf.
