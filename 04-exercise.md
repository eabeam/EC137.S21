# Exercise 4

**Due 18 April @ 11:59pm**

[TOC]

**You can work individually or in groups of 2 or 3.** If you work in pairs/groups, you may submit one assignment for all of you. 

**There is no associated Exercise 04 Quiz**

## Objectives

In short, Exercise 04 is about building readiness for Capstone 02. Essentially, I'm just making you do some of your Capstone 02 work in advance. 

Because Capstone 02 can be done individually or in groups of 2 or 3, you can *also* do this for Exercise 4! 

Is it okay if things change between now and Capstone 02? Of course. 



## Getting started

Start by reading the two introductions to Capstone 02

- Read through the [project description](Capstone 02.html) and prompts
- Read the specifications powerpoint:  	[pptx](Capstone2_Presentation.pptx)		[pdf](Capstone2_Presentation.pdf)

Think about what you might want to do!

There are two options for this exercise: 

## Option A: Proposal + graph demo

*For my own sanity, please submit this entire assignment in one Markdown file.* 

### Part 1: Idea proposal

Complete this idea proposal. It can be *literally* three medium-complete sentences.

1. What is the question you are going to answer for Capstone 02
2. What is the data source you are going to use? 
3. Who are you working with and/or are you looking for a project buddy? Correct answers include but are not limited to: 
   1. I'm working by myself and I'm happy about that
   2. I'm working with Ashley and we would be open to one more person
   3. I'm working with James and Tyra.

### Part 2: Exploratory work

Take 

## Option B: Rough draft

Submit the rough draft of your slide deck. To be considered complete "enough," you should have at least the following: 

	 - Frame of entire presentation (gaps ok)
	 - Versions of at least two charts - it is okay if they are rough.

More complete = more feedback!
