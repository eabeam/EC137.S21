R Stars

Alternative assignment



Based on our brainstorming, I've thought of a few demos that would be very helpful for students: 

- Creating a chloropleth map with ggplot
  - State-level and/or county level
- 

- mapping (topics NOT covered in the intro course)
  - `geom_sf()`
  - `tmap`
  - `tidycensus`
  - `tidygeocoder`
  - `countrycode`
  - `osmdata`
  - `rayshader`
- Manipulating data with functional programming using `purrr`
- Manipulating strings with regular expressions - I recommend starting with `stringr`, including its cheatsheet.
- Using python in R with `reticulate`
- Text analysis with `tidytext`
- Analyzing missing data with `naniar`
- Using the `data.table` library to manipulate data.
- Nice ways to display tables: `DT`, `gt`, `kable`, `kableExtra`, etc.
- Have something else you want to talk about? Great! Check in with me, and it will likely work.
